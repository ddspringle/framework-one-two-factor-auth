# FW/1 Two-Factor Authentication Example

This project has been superceeded by the [Secure Authentication Example](https://github.com/ddspringle/framework-one-secure-auth) which now contains both single and two-factor authentication modes. You can still get to the old code by using the `legacy` branch, but this code base is officially unsupported. We recommend using the [Secure Authentication Example](https://github.com/ddspringle/framework-one-secure-auth) instead.
